         <h4>Research Experience</h4>
           
         <hr>
             
        <p>My research interest lies in the intersection area of PPML, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, cryptography, information security, virtual reality, data mining,
                reinforcement learning, NLP, HPC, and parallel computing. My most recent work focused on developing a spoken dialogue system in a controlled knowledge base. Where I
                designed and developed a VR lab for college experiments and provided a virtual assistant in the virtual lab experiments. I also have worked with Padma Shri Prof. Balki at
                Supercomputer Education Research Centre, IISc. On “ Automated Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System,” where I wrote code for validating DSA, ECDSA, RSA, etc.
                cryptographic algorithms. In between, I managed two servers, GitHub, and conducted a few workshops. On weekends, I teach “AI with Python” to two USA-based freshman.
